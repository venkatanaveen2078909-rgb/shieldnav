# 🛡️ ShieldNav – AI-Powered Accident-Aware Route Planner

ShieldNav is a **safety-first navigation web application** that helps users choose **safer routes**, not just faster ones.  
Instead of focusing only on travel time, ShieldNav analyzes **accident-prone zones**, calculates a **safety score**, and provides **real-time warnings and emergency support**.

Built with **React, Vite, Leaflet (OpenStreetMap), OSRM, and Supabase**.

## 🧠 How ShieldNav Works

1. User logs in using Supabase Authentication  
2. Dashboard loads with Leaflet map  
3. User selects source & destination  
4. OSRM calculates possible routes  
5. Accident hotspots are fetched from Supabase  
6. Safety score is calculated for each route  
7. Safer routes are highlighted  
8. Navigation mode provides live warnings  
9. SOS button shares location in emergencies
